D2Jive.

Created by Spencer Spezzano and Drew Monroe.

This was our final project of our 3 month course in General Assembly's WDI program.  The app was built in our final week with backbone.js on rails.  

We used Songkick, Yelp and Spotify APIs to create a search engine for anyone, anywhere to find a nearby venue and the venue's upcoming live events.  A user has the additional option of being able to listen to some of the artist's music on a spotfiy wdiget or can be reidrected to buy tickets if applicable for the event.
